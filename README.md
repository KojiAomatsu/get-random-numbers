# get-random-numbers

## About
This is the web application to generate random numbers.
### Development
I made this app to practice React.js.
You can run this app by the commands below.
```
git clone git@github.com:KojiAomatsu/get-random-numbers.git
cd get-random-numbers
yarn start
```
### Customize
You can customize the maximum number and the amount of the numbers you will get.
But you need to edit the MainApp class in src/index.js.
To customize them, change the state in constructor method.
You can find
```
{
  ...
  amount : 2,
  maximum : 2000
  ...
}
```

NOTE:
This function should be provided from the page.
But there was some trouble, and I can get the results which I wanted to, so I've finished to develop this app.
This function may be added probably when I get familiar with JavaScript.
